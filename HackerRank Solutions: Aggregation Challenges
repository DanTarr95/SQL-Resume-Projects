1.Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California. 
Answer: SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';

2. Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.
Answer: SELECT AVG(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';

3. Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.
Answer: SELECT FLOOR (AVG(POPULATION)) FROM CITY;

4. Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.
Answer: SELECT SUM(POPULATION) FROM CITY WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';

5. Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.
Answer: SELECT MAX(POPULATION) - MIN(POPULATION) FROM CITY;

6. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
Answer: SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES;

7. We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly worked,and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.
Answer: SELECT MONTHS*SALARY AS EARNINGS, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY EARNINGS ORDER BY EARNINGS DESC LIMIT 1;

8. Query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),2),ROUND(SUM(LONG_W),2) FROM STATION;

9. Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7880 AND LAT_N < 137.2345;

10. Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345;

11. Query the Western Longitudes (LONG_N) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345);

12. Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;

13. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) where the smallest Northern Latitutde (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places. 
Answer: SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780);

14. Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(ABS(MIN(LAT_N) - MAX(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)),4) FROM STATION;

15. Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POWER(MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N),2)+POWER(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W),2)),4) FROM STATION;

16. A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.
Answer: SELECT ROUND(ST.LAT_N, 4) FROM STATION AS ST WHERE (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < ST.LAT_N) = (SELECT COUNT(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > ST.LAT_N);
